Welcome to the **ultimate friendship stress test** — a dynamic, customizable web app designed to humiliate, troll, and weird out your friends in the most *nuclear* way possible. From fake confessions to subtle rickrolls, this is your complete friendship day weapon.

- 🎓 **Friendship Certificate Generator**  
  Get a totally legit diploma proving your 1000-year-old bond.

- 🧠 **Friendship Quiz**  
  “How well do you know me?” turns into “Why are we even friends?”
  
- 🏃‍♂️ **Submit Button That Runs Away**  
  They’ll never click it. You’ll never stop laughing.

- 🕰️ **Friendship Timeline Generator**  
  AI-generated “memories” you never had. (Or wish you didn’t.)

- ✨ **Compliment Generator**  
  Weirdly nice things that sound suspiciously sarcastic.

- 🐸 **Spin the Roast Wheel**  
  Randomized verbal violence.

- 🗿 **Legacy Mode**  
  Old-school HTML aesthetic with 90s bling and Comic Sans.

- 🔓 **Unlockable Levels**  
  As they explore, new pages unlock. Surprise, horror, joy.

- 🔐 **Customizable Prank URLs**  
  Every user gets a personal link with their name, so they can prank friends too:  
  `https://yourdomain.com/f/<slug>`

## 🔧 Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/friendship-prank-engine.git
cd friendship-prank-engine

# Install deps
npm install

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL, Firebase keys, etc.

# Run dev server
npm run dev

🧠 How It Works

1. Users go to the homepage and customize their prank set.


2. A unique link is generated (/f/:slug).


3. When friends open the link, they fall into the prank vortex.


4. Each page reacts based on the slug’s settings and progress.


5. Analytics & unlockables track chaos caused.



🚨 Abuse Prevention

To avoid spam:

Optional login for prank creators

Link expiration & access limits

Rate-limiting + abuse detection
